    <h2>Assignment Operators</h2>
    <p>Operator sign "=" Example "m=10" Equivalent Expression "m=10"</p>
    <p>Operator sign "+=" Example "m+=10" Equivalent Expression "m = m+10" </p>
    <p>Operator sign "-=" Example "m-=10" Equivalent Expression "m = m-10" </p>
    <p>Operator sign "*=" Example "m*=10" Equivalent Expression "m = m*10"   </p>
    <p>Operator sign "/=" Example "m/=10" Equivalent Expression "m = m/10"   </p>
    <p>Operator sign "%=" Example "m%=" Equivalent Expression "m = m%10"   </p>
    <!-- <p>Operator sign "<<=" Example "a<<=b" Equivalent Expression "a = a<<b" </p> -->
    <p>Operator sign ">>=" Example "a>>=b" Equivalent Expression "a=a>>b"   </p>
    <p>Operator sign ">>>=" Example "a>>>=b" Equivalent Expression "a=a>>>b"   </p>
    <p>Operator sign "&=" Example "a&=b" Equivalent Expression "a=a&b"   </p>
    <p>Operator sign "^=" Example "a^=b" Equivalent Expression "a=a^b"   </p>
    <p>Operator sign "|=" Example "a|=b" Equivalent Expression "a=a|b"   </p>

    <p>Example : var m = 15;
                     m += 10;
                     document.write(m);
                     Answer = 25.
