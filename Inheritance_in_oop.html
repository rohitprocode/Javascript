<h1>Inheritance in Javascript</h1>

    <strong><p>
        Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.Inheritance is useful feature that allows code reusability.
    </p></strong>
    <h4>Example: 1</h4>
    <p>This represents a multi-tier inheritance wherein in the child class inherits from a parent class which in itself is a child class to another parent class.A real-life example would be a child inheriting from his father who inherit from his grandfather.</p>
