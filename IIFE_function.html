    IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
</h1>

<body>
    <strong>
        <p>
            IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a javascript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a design pattern which is also known as self-executing anonymous function and contains two major
            parts. The first is the anonymous function with loxical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator().This
            prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second part is creating the Immediately executing function expression(), through which the javascript
            engine will directly interpret the function.
        </p>

    <h4>Syntax:
        <pre>
        (function () { block of statements ;})();
    </pre>
    </h4>
    <h4>Example : 1</h4>
    <script>
        (function () { document.write("Hello <br/>"); })();

        //With parameter

        (function (a, b) { document.write(a + " " + b); })(10, 20);
    </script>
    <strong>
        <p>Points to Remember:-</p>
        <p>1.Avoid creating global variables and functions.</p>
        <p>As it doesn't define variables and functions globally.So there will be no name conflicts.</p>
        <p>Scope is limited to that particular function.</p>
    </strong>
    <h4>Example: 2</h4>
    <script>
        //Anonymous Function
      var a = function(){ document.write("Rohit Shows <br/>"); }
      a();

      //IIFE function
      (function () {document.write("Rohit Rathore <br/>");})();

            //With Parameter

            (function (a,b) {document.write(a + b);})(50,50);
    </script>

</body>
