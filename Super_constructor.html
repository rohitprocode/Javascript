    <h1>Super Constructor in Javascript</h1>
    <strong>The super keyword in JavaScript acts as a reference variable to the parent class. It is mainly used when we
        want to access a variable, method, or constructor in the base class from the derived class.</strong>
    <mark>
        <strong>
            Super() is used to initialize parent class constructor.If there is a constructor present in a subclass,it needs to first call super() before using "this".A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of a parent class.
