<h1>Objects in Javascript</h1>
<body>
    <strong>
        <p>An Object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name ( or key ) and a value. A property's value can be function, in which case the property is known as a method.In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.</p>
    </strong>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <pre>
        var fees = {

                These are object properties
                    Rahul = 100,
                    Sumit = 200,
                    Rohan = 300

                total:function(){return (100 + 200 + 300);}  These are Methods
        };

                //Object Structure
    </pre>
    <h3>Types Of Objects</h3>
    <h4>User-defined Objects : </h4>
    <p>These are custom objects created by the programmer to bring structure and consistency to a particular programming task.</p>

    <h4>Native Objects :</h4>
    <strong><p>These are provided by the javascript language itself like String, Number, Boolean, Function, Date, Object, Array, Math, RegExp, Error as well as object that allow creation of user-defined objects and composite types.</p></strong>

    <h4>Host Objects :</h4>
    <p>These objects are not specified as part of the javascript language but that are supported by most host environments, typically browsers like window, navigator.</p>

    <h4>Document Objects :</h4>
    <p>These are part of the Document Object Model(DOM), as defined by the W3C. These Objects presents present the programmer with a structured interface to HTML and XML Documents.Access to the document object is provided by the browser via the document property of the window object (window.document)</p>
