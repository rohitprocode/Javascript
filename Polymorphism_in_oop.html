<h1>Polymorphism in Javascript  //OOP</h1>
<body>
    <strong><p>Polymorphism merans 'many forms', and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.</p></strong>
    
    <h1>Example: 1</h1>
    <p>1. A person at the same time ca have different characteristics.Like a man at the same time is a father,a husband,an employee.So ther person posses different behaviour in different situations.This is the real life example of polymorphism.</p>
    <p>2. Call centre is also the example of polymorphism.When you call at call centre you get that:- 
        <br>
        Press 0 to call, Press 1 to cancel, Press 2 to order.So this process in which we get different output in the same function, this is called as polymorphism.
