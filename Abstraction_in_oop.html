<h1>Abstraction in Javascript    //OOP </h1>
<body>
    <strong><p>
        An Abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users.In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.
    </p></strong>
    <h4>Example: 1</h4>
    <h3>Your Car</h3>
    <p>Your car is a great Example of an abstraction.You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button.You don't need to know how the engine is getting started,what all components your car has.The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user. </p>
